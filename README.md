# Bikesharing

## Project Overview
For this project I created a bike trip analysis on Citi bike data in New York City, utilizing Tableau. In understanding the data and creating visualizations, one can effectively better understand usage patterns, peak and low times, and the average consumer profile for bike users. For potential investors who may want to create or partner with bike sharing programs in their city, such as in Des Moines, this analysis can aid in demonstrating the potential success such a venture can bring. In order to expand, the initial steps require the data to tell its story.

The finalized Tableau story of the Citi Bike analysis can be found here: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leila4630/viz/CitiBikeSharingAnalysis_16543575020420/BikeSharingAnalysis?publish=yes)
